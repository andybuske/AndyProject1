## ORIENTATION

![Screen shot of the game layout at the start](https://github.com/andybuske/AndyProject1/blob/main/Screen_shot-Initial1.png) 

  * The two possible decks are listed, each with their own button.
  * The Category and Deck Name are displayed above the card.
  * Front of card (question) is shown with a blue card outline and is displayed large centered on the card.
  * Back of card is initially hidden.  Once clicked, the back of the card (answer) is shown with a red outline and is displayed smaller in the upper left corner of the card.
  * The number of **Cards Remaining** is displayed below the cards.
  * User can select whether they got the answer Correct or Incorrect.
  * User can skip forward or backward to cards they haven't yet gotten Correct.


## GAME PLAY
The deck automatically displays a blank card when the page is loaded.  
  You can flip the card or skip forward/back without impacting game play (UX).
You simply click one of the Deck buttons at the top to load a deck and begin playing. 
Once you answer the question, click anywhere on the card to flip it to the back side to see the answer.
  * If you got it right, click the _Correct_ button.  You will not see this card again.
  * If you got it wrong, click the _Incorrect_ button.  You will see this card again at the end.

You are able to Skip a card (forward or backward), **but only if you _haven't_ yet seen the back of the card**.  
  Once you see the back of the card, the _Skip_ buttons are disabled and you must choose either _Correct_ or _Incorrect_.

Once you have successfully answered all of the questions, you will get an alert.
